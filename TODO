Challenge:

Groover is helping artists to reach music industry professionals and establish a connection with them that will help them build their career. In order to match the fittest industry professionals to a given artistic project, one must make sure that we store artist data properly and have enough information to characterize their project.

For this challenge you will need to gain more knowledge about how popular are our users on Spotify. To do so, you are given a dataset to clean that contain the following 4 tables:

Artist table: user ID, artist name
Spotify Artist table: user ID, spotify ID, User ID
Artist Tag table: user ID, tag ID
Genre Tag table: ID, band ID, tag name
All the data is available here

Your Goal

Through this challenge, you will have to gain more insights from Groover's artists popularity. This information is given by Spotify's API, which contains a "popularity" metric per artist. Once you have gathered Spotify data, you need to make sure that the information you gathered corresponds to what is stored in the database.

To sum up, your tasks are the following:

Retrieve popularity score of each artist
Make sure artist name on our platform and the ones given on Spotify are matching
Additional question:

Write a SQL query that lists all artists given above with: their spotify_id, their user_id, their genres, the total number of genres theyâ€™re assigned to, and the total number of artists assigned to the genre.
